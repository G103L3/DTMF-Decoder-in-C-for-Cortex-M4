/**
 * \brief Simplified interface to perform FFT on a complex array of voltage levels
 * \param x Pointer to a complex array of voltage levels
 * \param N The number of samples in the array, should be a power of two
 * \returns A pointer to a global array representing the frequency spectrum of the input signal, note that this is not thread-safe
 * 
 * This function provides a simplified interface to perform the FFT, suitable for straightforward use cases. It wraps the operations of computing twiddle factors and executing the FFT into a single call, managing all intermediate storage internally. This is ideal for single-threaded applications where ease of use is more critical than modularity.
