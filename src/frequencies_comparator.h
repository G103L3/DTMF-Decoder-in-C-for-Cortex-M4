* \brief Compares the input frequencies to the DTMF frequency matrix and determines the corresponding key.
*
* This function takes in a struct containing the high and low frequencies of a DTMF signal, pointers to the last character detected and the character sequence. 
* It then determines the key that corresponds to the input frequencies and adds it to the character sequence, if it is a new character, also handles the case where OVERFLOW is detected. 
* The function also handles the case where no DTMF signal is detected or multiple DTMF signals are detected.
